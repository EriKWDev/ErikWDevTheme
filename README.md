# ErikWDev ayu Theme
## Thanks to the AYU project
Do you like the formatting? Don't thank me. This theme is based on the amazing "ayu" theme/project that can be found here https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu and here https://github.com/dempfi/ayu. I used their generator code but with custom colors to create a theme that I like.

## Here is a sample of some python code
Checkout https://github.com/Canvim/PyPen for an interesting python project!
